      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Our purpose is to help you find weekly groups, gatherings, and
          events for Christian young adults in Philadelphia and surrounding
          areas.</li>
        <li>We believe Jesus is the Son of God. He took our place on the cross
          to atone for our sins and rose from the dead. Whoever believes in Him
          will have eternal life with Him.</li>
        <li>We desire to spread the Gospel to all the world, to love others as
          Christ loves, to worship God with our brothers and sisters in Christ,
          and to study God's Word together.</li>

    <p>"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that
    whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."
